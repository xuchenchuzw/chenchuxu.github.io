            In the context of liver tumor detection, traditional techniques utilizing contrast agents provide relatively
            accurate diagnosis, but also bring potential high risks to patients, such as allergic reactions to contrast
            agents, and increased detection complexity and cost. Therefore, being able to reliably detect liver tumors
            from non-contrast-enhanced images without the use of contrast agents would be a significant advancement, not
            only eliminating the risks of using contrast agents but also preventing discrepancies in experience among
            radiologists and simplifying clinical workflows. The development and deployment of such technology,
            especially if it can achieve the same detection reliability as using contrast agents, will have tremendous
            clinical value.

            Chenchu Xu of Anhui University, in collaboration with Dr. Shuo Li of Case Western Reserve University, has
            proposed a new Spatiotemporal Knowledge Teacher-student Reinforcement Learning (SKT-RL) method, aimed at
            efficiently and safely detecting liver tumors without the use of contrast agents. This technology, through a
            teacher-student framework, extracts explicit liver tumor knowledge from clear contrast-enhanced images to
            guide another network to directly detect tumors from non-enhanced images. Through SKT-RL's innovative
            strategies in knowledge construction, transmission, and optimization, it not only enhances detection
            accuracy but also simplifies clinical processes and reduces diagnostic costs to some extent. Experiments on
            a liver tumor dataset containing 375 patients demonstrated that this method achieved outstanding performance
            in the task of liver tumor detection without contrast enhancement, opening a new chapter in non-contrast
            agent liver tumor technology.

      <h2>1. Research background</h2>
      <article class="center">
        <div>
          <div class="bottomPadding">
            The method of detecting liver tumors without the use of contrast enhancement is particularly beneficial for
            patients allergic to contrast agents or pregnant women, as contrast agents may pose risks to these groups.
            Liver tumor detection without contrast enhancement can provide diagnostic results that rival those obtained
            with contrast agents, highlighting the potential of non-enhanced imaging as a reliable alternative for liver
            tumor detection. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the non-contrast-enhanced detection method brings multiple
            benefits: firstly, it eliminates the high risks associated with contrast agents, especially for patients
            with renal failure who are prone to deadly nephrogenic systemic fibrosis; secondly, it reduces the
            experience gap among radiologists by eliminating the subjectivity and non-reproducible nature of visual
            assessment, thereby reducing high observer variability; thirdly, it simplifies clinical workflows by
            reducing the need for multiple scans, thus saving costs and clinical resources.
          </div>
          <div class="bottomPadding">
            The method of detecting liver tumors without contrast enhancement faces a significant challenge, namely that
            liver tumors may be invisible on non-contrast-enhanced images. The teacher-student deep reinforcement
            learning has shown great potential to be a solution. More specifically, on contrast-enhanced images, liver
            tumors are very easy to see due to the additional enhancement of the tumors. Conversely, on
            non-contrast-enhanced liver images, tumors may be barely visible or even invisible. This makes traditional
            deep learning technologies based on direct mapping struggle to learn accurate representations of the tumors
            and provide reliable detection. The teacher-student deep reinforcement learning has become a very promising
            method to address detecting hard-to-identify liver tumors without contrast enhancement. This framework uses
            deep reinforcement learning to improve the feature space of the tumors, consisting of two deep reinforcement
            learning-based modules: a teacher network and a student module. The teacher network learns from
            contrast-enhanced liver images, while the teacher network learns from non-contrast-enhanced liver images.
            Then, the framework uses the tumor detection knowledge learned by the teacher network to guide the teacher
            network in detecting hard-to-identify tumors in non-contrast-enhanced images.

            At MICCAI-2022, the authors introduced a ternary knowledge set to construct the teacher-student deep
            reinforcement learning framework, significantly enhancing its performance in liver tumor detection without
            contrast enhancement. This ternary knowledge set, including actions, rewards, and features, is collected
            from the teacher network, and shared with the student model to guide its exploration. This ternary knowledge
            enables the student network not only to be guided on what action to take but also to understand why to take
            that action by using the features, which provide the underlying explanation and purpose for the action and
            reward.

            In this paper, the authors propose a new Spatiotemporal Knowledge Teacher-Student Reinforcement Learning
            (SKT-RL) method to enhance the construction, transfer, and optimization of the aforementioned ternary
            knowledge set, thereby improving the results of liver tumor detection without contrast enhancement. As shown
            in Fig. 3, first, SKT-RL includes a unique spatiotemporal ternary knowledge set that integrates the action
            and its underlying rationale of deep reinforcement learning, i.e., the dual rationale within each state
            (space) and within related historical states (time). In deep reinforcement learning sequential
            decision-making, the integrated representation of 'what to do' and 'why' significantly enhances the teaching
            capability of the framework. Secondly, SKT-RL features a pixel-level momentum transfer strategy, which
            transfers sequence state features and actions at the pixel level, enhancing the accuracy of the knowledge
            received by the student module. Here, SKT-RL introduces an adaptive controller, gradually reducing the
            student module's dependency on the teacher module. Finally, SKT-RL also includes a new phase trend reward
            function, combining different detection phases and historical trends. This function allows the teacher
            network to adaptively select the best method for evaluating actions, thereby achieving more targeted network
            training and increased robustness.

            contrast-enhanced liver MR images.

            The purple bounding boxes indicate detection results obtained using various methods, while the white

          <div class="bottomPadding">
            As shown in Tab. 1, in the quantified results across various detection metrics, SKT-RL improves the
            pixel-level detection accuracy by 10.1% - 1.1%, Dice coefficient by 30.4% - 2.3%, recall (sensitivity) by
            16.2% - 3.9%, and precision by 24.8% - 4.4% compared to the six combottomPaddingtive methods. Notably,
            SKT-RL achieves the lowest standard deviation in terms of pixel-level detection accuracy and the Dice
            coefficient metric. Furthermore, SKT-RL surpasses all detection metrics compared to the MICCAI-2022
            conference paper version, with an increase of 1.1% in pixel-level detection accuracy, 2.3% in the Dice
            coefficient, 3.9% in recall (sensitivity), and 4.4% in precision. These results validate the effectiveness
            of the proposed spatio-temporal ternary knowledge set, pixel-level momentum migration strategy, and phase
            trend reward in accurately representing the teacher network’s knowledge during DRL sequential decisions and
            effectively transferring it to guide the student network. Moreover, compared to the detection results on
            contrast-enhanced MR images, which is the upper bound for this task, SKT-RL achieves considerably close
            accuracy. For instance, in terms of the Dice coefficient, the result on non-contrast-enhanced MR images is
            only 3.21% lower than that on contrast-enhanced MR images.

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <article class="center">
        <div class="bottomPadding">
          This research proposes a novel Spatiotemporal Knowledge Teacher-student Reinforcement Learning (SKT-RL)
          framework for directly detecting liver tumors from non-enhanced liver tumor MR images. This method introduces
          a powerful spatiotemporal triad knowledge set to represent the intrinsic knowledge of the teacher network when
          detecting tumors on contrast-enhanced liver tumor MR images. Additionally, a new pixel-level momentum transfer
          strategy is introduced, enabling the knowledge set of the teacher network to effectively guide the student
          network in detecting tumors from non-enhanced liver tumor MR images, and eventually to break free from the
          knowledge of self-exploration detection. Lastly, a phase trend reward function is utilized, integrating the
          knowledge set and transfer strategy into the student and teacher networks, and enabling all components to be
          trained cohesively and efficiently. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art performance in detecting
          liver tumors without using contrast agents, reaching a Dice coefficient of 71.37% and an accuracy of 69.06%
          using data from 395 subjects. These results suggest that the proposed framework has immense potential to
          become a highly efficient and accurate clinical tool for diagnosing liver tumors, avoiding the emerging toxic
          issues related to contrast agents."
