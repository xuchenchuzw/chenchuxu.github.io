        I am an associate professor at School of Computer Science and Technology, Anhui University (AHU). Before joining AHU, I was a postdoc at <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/" target="_blank">Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry,
        Western University (UWO)</a>, Canada, working with Prof.
        <a href="http://www.digitalimaginggroup.ca/members/shuo.php/" target="_blank">Shuo Li</a>.
        I obtained the Ph.D in computer Science from Anhui University
        and the M.Sc. degree in computer science from the <a /href="http://www.hfut.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Hefei University of Technology</a>
        and the B.Sc. degree in network engineering from the <a /href="https://www.aeu.edu.cn/main.htm" target="_blank">University of Electronic Engineering</a>

        </p>

        <p align='justify'>
        I am always looking for highly-motivated students with strong mathematical background or excellent coding skills.
        If you are interested in working with me,
        please send me an email about your interests and background (attaching your CV, transcripts, and any previous research papers).
